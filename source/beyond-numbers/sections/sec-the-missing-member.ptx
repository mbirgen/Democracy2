    <title>The Missing Member.</title>
    <p>
        Around 1872 the German mathematician Georg Cantor shook the foundations of infinity
        when he showed that the set of real numbers has more elements than the set of natural
        numbers. In other words, he proved that infinity is not one size but that some infinities are
        more infinite than others. At first such a notion seems almost nonsensical. Once we have
        reached infinity, surely we cannot climb farther. But Cantor showed that there were yet
        higher mountains to scale.

        To show that the real numbers are more numerous than the natural numbers, Cantor
        focused intently on what it would mean for the real numbers and the natural numbers to
        have the same cardinality. It would mean that the real and natural numbers could be put
        in one-to-one correspondence. Writing down what such a correspondence might look like
        gives us a visual clue how to demonstrate conclusively that any attempted correspondence
        between the natural numbers and the real numbers could not include every real; some real
        is missing-the <em>missing member</em>.
    </p>

        To figure out Cantor's argument, we need to recall that each real number can be expressed
        as an infinitely long decimal expansion. For example,
        <me>
             243.476666875446800887672875849345788445321...

        is a real number. Before moving forward, we must first make an easy observation about real numbers. 
        Suppose we examine two decimal numbers, but we cover up all the digits in the numbers with ?s except for the digit that is in, say, the fifth place after the decimal point.
        So, we have a piece of paper with two funny looking numbers on 1't : ??.????2????... and ??.????4????.... 
        We do not know what these numbers are because we can read only the fifth digit after the decimal point. 
        But one thing we do know is that these two numbers are different. If they were the same, 
        we could not have a 2 in the fifth place after the decimal point of one number and a 4 in the fifth place in the other. 
        Likewise, if we have two numbers and one has a 2 and the other has a 4 in the 87th place after the decimal, then the two numbers must be different. 
        This observation is not hard to understand, but it is a key to Cantor's reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cantor proved that there are more real numbers than natural numbers through a clever,
        yet simple idea. If the set of real numbers and the set of natural numbers had the same
        cardinality, then there would be a one-to- one correspondence between the set of natural
        numbers and the set of real numbers. So his idea was to list the natural numbers down the
        left-hand side of a page, list reals in the right-hand column, and then show how to construct
        a real number that could not appear on the list. He showed that, once we commit ourselves
        to a list of reals in the right-hand column, one real number corresponding to each natural
        number, then we can describe a real decimal number that does not appear anywhere on that
        infinite list. So, we could not have listed all the real numbers in the right-hand column. Thus,
        the natural numbers and the real numbers could not be put in one-to-one correspondence,
        and so there are more real numbers than natural numbers. Cantor's basic strategy was to
        attempt an impossible task in order to understand why it couldn't be done.

        We are going to write down a particular real number that we will call <em>M</em>, for "missing." 
        We will write it in its decimal expansion. Our number <em>M</em> will be between 0 and 1, so its decimal expansion begins with: 0.???...
        Now, we must decide what the digits “???” will be. Each digit will be one of two possibilities: either 2 or 4. 
        We will determine the digits of our number <em>M</em> one at a time, successively—so we must be patient. 
        We now describe the criterion by which we choose each digit of our number <em>M</em>.
