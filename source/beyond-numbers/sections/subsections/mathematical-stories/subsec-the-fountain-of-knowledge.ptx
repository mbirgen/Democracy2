    <title>The Fountain of Knowledge</title>
    <p>
        During an incredibly elaborate hazing stunt during pledge week, Trey Sheik suddenly found
        himself alone in the Sahara desert. His desire to become a fraternity brother was now
        overshadowed by his desire to find something to drink (these desires, of course, are not
        unrelated). As he wandered aimlessly through the desert sands, he began to regret his
        involvement in the whole frat scene. Both hours and miles had passed and Trey was near
        dehydration. Only now did Trey appreciate the advantages of sobriety. Suddenly, as though
        it were a mirage, Trey came upon an oasis.

        There, sitting in a shaded kiosk beside a small pool of mango nectar, was an old man
        named Al Donte. Big Al, not only ran the mango bar but was also a travel agent and
        could book Trey on a two-humped camel back to Michigan. At the moment, however, Trey
        desired nothing but a large drink of that beautifully translucent and refreshing mangoade.
        Al informed Trey that the juice was sold only in 8 ounce servings and that the cost for one
        serving was $3.50. Trey frantically searched on his pockets and found some change and much
        sand. Trey counted and discovered that he had exactly $3.50.

        Trey's jubilation at the thought of liquid coating his dried and chapped throat was quickly
        shattered when Al casually announced that there were no 8- ounce glasses available. Al had
        only a 6- ounce glass and a 10- ounce glass-neither of which would have any markings on
        them. Al, being a man of his word, would not hear of selling any more or any less than an
        8- ounce serving of his libation. Trey, in desperation, wondered whether it was possible to
        use two glasses to produce exactly 8- ounces of mango juice in the 10- ounce glass. Trey
        thought and thought. Do you think it is possible to use only the unmarked 6- and 10- ounce
        glasses to produce exactly 8 ounces in the 10 ounce glass? If so, explain how, if not, explain
        why not.
