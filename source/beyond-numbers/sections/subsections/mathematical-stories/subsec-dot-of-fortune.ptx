    <title>Dot of Fortune</title>
    <p>
        One day three college students were selected at random from the studio audience to play the
        ever-popular TV game show, “Dot of Fortune.” One of the students already had discovered
        the power and beauty of mathematical thinking, while the other two were not nearly so
        fortunate. The stage had no mirrors, reflecting surfaces, or television monitors. The three
        students were led blindfolded to their places around a small round table. As the rules of
        the game were explained by Pat, Vanna affixed to each of the three youthful foreheads a
        conspicuous but small colored dot.

        “So, contestants,” Pat explained, “at the bell your blindfolds will be removed. You will
        see your two companions sitting quietly at the table, each with a dot on his or her forehead.
        Each dot is either red or white. You cannot, of course, see the dot on your own forehead.
        After you have observed the dots on your companions' foreheads, you will raise your hand
        if you see at least one red dot. If you do not see a red dot, you will keep your hands on the
        table. The object of the game is to deduce the color of your own dot. As soon as you know
        the color of your dot, you are to hit the buzzer in front of you. Do you understand the rules
        of the game?” All the students understood the rules, although the math fan understood
        them better.

        “Are you ready?” asked Vanna after affixing three red dots to the foreheads of the three
        students. After the three contestants nodded, Vanna instructed them to simultaneously
        remove their blindfolds as the studio audience quivered with anticipation. The three students
        looked at one another's dots, and all raised their hands. After some time, the math fan hit
        her buzzer knowing what color dot she had. Please explain how she knew this. Why did the
        other students not know?
