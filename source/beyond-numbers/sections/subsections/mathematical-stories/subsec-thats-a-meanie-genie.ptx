    <title>That's a Meanie Genie</title>
    <p>
        On an archaeological dig in the Highlands of Tibet, Allie discovered an ancient oil lamp.
        Just for laughs she rubbed the lamp. She quickly stopped laughing when the huge puff of a
        magenta smoke sprouted from the lamp, and an ornery genie in Murray appeared. Murray,
        looking at the stunned Allie, exclaimed, “Well, what are you staring at? Okay, okay, you've
        found me; you get your three wishes. So what will they be?” Allie, although in shock,
        realized what an incredible opportunity she had. Thinking quickly, she said, “I'd like to find
        the Rama Nujan, the jewel that was first discovered by Hardy, the High Lama.”

         “You got it,” replied Murray, and instantly nine identical looking stones appeared. Allie
 looked at the stones and was unable to differentiate anyone from the others.

        Finally, she said to Murray, “So where is the Rama Nujan?” Murray explained, “It is
        embedded in one of the stones. You said you wished to find it. So now you have to find it.
        Oh, by the way, you may take only one of the stones with you, so you had best be careful
        how you choose!” “But they look identical to me. How will I know which one has the Rama
        Nujan in it?” Allie questioned. “Well, eight of the stones weigh the same, but the stone
        containing the jewel weighs slightly more than the others,” Murray responded with a devilish
        grin.

        Allie, now getting annoyed, whispered under her breath, “Gee, I wish I had a balance
        scale.” Suddenly a balance scale appeared. “That was wish two!” declared Murray. “Hey,
        that's not fair!” Allie cried. “You want to talk fair? You think it's fair to be locked in a
        lamp for 1729 years? You know you can't get internet in there, and there's no room for a
        satellite dish! So don't talk to me about fair,” Murray explained. Realizing he had gone a
        bit overboard, Murray proclaimed, “Hey, I want to help you out, so let me give you a tip:
        that balance scale may only be used once.” “What? Only once?” she said, thinking out
        loud. “I wish I had another balance scale.” ZAP! Another scale appeared. “Okay, kiddo,
        that was wish three.” Murray snickered. “Hey, just one minute,” Allie said now regretting
        not having asked for $1 million or something more standard. “Well at least this new scale
        works correctly, right?” “Sure, just like the other one. You may use it only once.” “Why?”
        Allie inquired. “Because it is a 'wished' balance scale. That means that you can only use it
        once since it was only one wish. It's just like you cannot wish for 100 more wishes.” “You
        are a very obnoxious genie.” “Hey, I don't make up the rules, lady, I just follow them.”

        So, Allie may use each of the two balance scales exactly once. Is it possible for Allie
        to select the slightly heavier stone containing the Rama Nujan stone from among the nine
        identical looking stones? Please explain why or why not.
