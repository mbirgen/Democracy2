    <p>
        Directions for the game:
    </p>
    <p>
        Player One begins by filling in the first horizontal row of her table with X's and O's.
        Then Player Two places either one X or one O in the first box of his board. The game
        continues with Player One writing down a run of six X's and/or O's in the second horizontal
        row of her board, followed by Player Two writing an X or O in the second box of his board.
        The game continues until all boxes on both boards are filled.
    </p>
    <p>
        Player One wins if any horizontal row she wrote down is identical to the row that Player
        Two created (Player One matches Player Two). Player Two wins if his row is not one of the
        six rows made by Player One (Player Two dodges Player One).

        Would you rather be Player One or Player Two? Who has the advantage? Why? Can
        you devise a strategy for either side that will always result in victory? This little game holds
        within it the key to understanding the sizes of infinity.
