    <title>What does "2" mean?</title>
    <p>
        Our journey to infinity begins with 2. We are all familiar with 2, and we will use that
        intuitive intimacy to develop a concept of size that will take us well beyond what we know.
    </p>

        If we have two apples and two hands, we could put one apple in each hand, and no hand
        would be un-appled, or any apple un-handed. If we have two socks and we put one sock on
        each hand, then our socks and our hands correspond exactly. This observation also implies
        that we can put one apple in each sock and demonstrate that the socks and apples also
        correspond; however, we do not recommend this last experiment unless the socks are clean.

        Grappling with infinity requires us to imagine physical scenarios that are not quite pos
        sible but can be clearly conceived in the mind. Suppose we have a huge barrel full of Volvos
        and a barrel full of soccer balls, and we want to know if there are more Volvos than soccer
        balls, more soccer balls than Volvos, or the same number of each. How would we decide?
    </p>
    <p>
        We could take one Volvo from the first barrel and one soccer ball from the second, pair
        them up and put them aside (probably putting the ball in the car's trunk). Then we could
        pair up another Volvo from the first barrel with another soccer ball from the second. If we
        continue pairing in this way and every car has a ball and every ball has a car, we know there
        are the same number of each.
    </p>
    <p>
        This simple idea is important. We have just described a method for determining when two
        collections have the same number of objects in them without actually naming that number.
        Two collections whose objects can be paired together evenly-one from one collection with
        one from the other collection-are said to have a <term>one-to-one correspondence</term>.

                            <term>The same, but unsure how much</term>. We have used a method of checking whether
                            two sets of objects have the same number of things by pairing up and removing one
                            object from each set until we run out. If we run out of objects from both sets at the
                            same time, then we know that the sets contain the same number of things. Otherwise,
                            we know that one set is larger than the other. Describe several events whereby we are
                            able to compare the size of two collections without computing the individual sizes-for
                            example, people filling all seats in an auditorium.
