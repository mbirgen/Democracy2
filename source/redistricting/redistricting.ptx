  <title>Redistricting</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        According to the Supreme Court, the Constitution requires that population must be equalized across districts. 
        The idea is that if one Iowan lives in a district with 1 million other voters while another Iowan lives in a 
        district with only 200,000 other voters, the second one's vote is more influential in choosing a member of Congress. 
        Of course, populations shift, growing or shrinking over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        To prevent those shifts from leaving unbalanced districts, state legislatures must redraw their electoral districts 
        every 10 years, after the Census Bureau releases its new population data. Redistricting regularly leads to heated 
        political and legal fights as legislators scramble to gain advantage for their parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the census has been taken and all the numbers have been added up and the apportionment problem has been solved 
        (up to the Supreme Court if necessary), it is time to divide up each state into districts (one per representative). 
        Some of the rules of redistricting are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Population must be equalized across districts.</p></li>
      <li><p>Each district must be (if possible) physically connected.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Additionally, each state has more rules that they have decided on. In most states, the party in power when the census 
        data comes out gets to draw in district lines for Federal Representatives and all state offices that need districts. 
        This process is done by hand often block by block. In 2011 the new field of data science made it possible for whoever 
        was in charge to manipulate the lines in such a way that their majority was nearly guaranteed in the near future.

    <title>Gerrymandering</title>
    
    <p>
        The process of dividing the state into the appropriate number of districts is called redistricting, but in the popular press, 
        it is often referred to as gerrymandering. This is because the map-makers often decide to split things up to their benefit. 
        One of the earliest, most obvious examples of this was in 1812 when Massachusetts Governor Gerry and his party drew one 
        district in such a curvy and jagged manner that the local press thought it looked like a Salamander and coined the term Gerrymander.

      <title>Simple State Redistricting</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>Consider a simple state with 50 people who belong to two different political parties: 
        20 Orange party members and 30 Teal party members. The census says that they should have 5 seats, 
        so we need to divide up these people into 5 groups of 10 people each.</p>
        
        <p>In the diagrams below, assume Orange party members are represented by solid squares and 
        Teal party members are represented by hatched squares, arranged in a 10×5 grid where the 
        bottom 2 rows are Orange (20 people) and the top 3 rows are Teal (30 people).</p>
      </introduction>
      
      <task>
        <title>Horizontal Districts</title>
        <statement>
          <p>Consider dividing the state into 5 horizontal districts (each district is one row). 
          Who would win with a majority of votes in each district? Who has an advantage in the legislature? 
          Does it seem fair? Are the people in each district connected to each other? Are the districts generally compact?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Row 1 (bottom): 10 Orange, 0 Teal → Orange wins</li>
              <li>Row 2: 10 Orange, 0 Teal → Orange wins</li>
              <li>Row 3: 0 Orange, 10 Teal → Teal wins</li>
              <li>Row 4: 0 Orange, 10 Teal → Teal wins</li>
              <li>Row 5 (top): 0 Orange, 10 Teal → Teal wins</li>
            </ul>
            Result: Orange wins 2 seats, Teal wins 3 seats. This is proportional to the population (40% vs 60%). 
            Districts are connected and compact.
          </p>
        </solution>

      <task>
        <title>Vertical Districts</title>
        <statement>
          <p>Consider dividing the state into 5 vertical districts (each district is two columns). 
          Who would win with a majority of votes in each district? Who has an advantage in the legislature? 
          Does it seem fair? Are the people in each district connected to each other? Are the districts generally compact?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Each vertical district contains 4 Orange voters (from bottom 2 rows) and 6 Teal voters (from top 3 rows).
            <ul>
              <li>District 1: 4 Orange, 6 Teal → Teal wins</li>
              <li>District 2: 4 Orange, 6 Teal → Teal wins</li>
              <li>District 3: 4 Orange, 6 Teal → Teal wins</li>
              <li>District 4: 4 Orange, 6 Teal → Teal wins</li>
              <li>District 5: 4 Orange, 6 Teal → Teal wins</li>
            </ul>
            Result: Orange wins 0 seats, Teal wins 5 seats. This gives Teal 100% of seats despite having only 60% of population. 
            Districts are connected and compact, but not proportionally representative.
          </p>

        <title>Gerrymandered Districts</title>
        <statement>
          <p>Consider a more complex districting scheme designed to favor the Orange party. 
          This might involve creating oddly-shaped districts that pack Teal voters into few districts 
          while spreading Orange voters to create slim majorities in most districts. 
          Analyze how this type of gerrymandering can distort representation.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Through careful district design, it would be possible to create districts where:
            <ul>
              <li>One district has 9-10 Teal voters (a "packed" district)</li>
              <li>Four districts each have 6 Orange and 4 Teal voters</li>
            </ul>
            This could result in Orange winning 4 out of 5 seats despite being only 40% of the population.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
    </activity>

    <p>The last example illustrates the "packing" and "cracking" strategies that are characteristic of modern gerrymandering:</p>

    <definition xml:id="def-packing">
      <statement>
        <p><term>Packing</term>: Putting a very large number of voters who all vote the same way in a single district. 
        In this case, the election is won by these voters, but by a very large margin, "wasting" many votes.</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition xml:id="def-cracking">
      <statement>
        <p><term>Cracking</term>: Putting a slight majority of voters for one party in a single district. 
        In this case, the election is won by these voters by a slim margin. There are a lot of minority voters 
        in the district, but not enough to ever win an election.</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <activity xml:id="act-proportional-representation">
      <title>Creating Proportional Representation</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Suppose a state has approximately 40% Orange party voters and 60% Teal party voters (distributed somewhat randomly). 
        The challenge is to divide the state into 10 districts in such a way that in an election, 40% of the seats will be won 
        by the Orange party and 60% by the Teal party.</p>
        
        <p>This means Orange should win 4 seats and Teal should win 6 seats. Describe a strategy for creating districts 
        that achieve this proportional representation, and explain why this might be difficult to achieve in practice.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>To achieve proportional representation:
        <ul>
          <li>Create 4 districts with slight Orange majorities (e.g., 6 Orange, 4 Teal each)</li>
          <li>Create 6 districts with slight Teal majorities (e.g., 4 Orange, 6 Teal each)</li>
        </ul>
        This is difficult because:
        <ul>
          <li>Voters are not uniformly distributed geographically</li>
          <li>Districts must be contiguous and reasonably compact</li>
          <li>Population equality requirements must be met</li>
          <li>The party in charge of redistricting has incentives to favor themselves</li>
        </ul>

    <title>Fairness</title>
    
    <p>Various mathematical measures have been developed to detect and quantify gerrymandering and ensure fairness in redistricting, including:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><p><term>Efficiency Gap</term>: Measures "wasted votes" - votes that don't contribute to victory</p></li>
      <li><p><term>Compactness Measures</term>: Geometric measures of how "oddly shaped" districts are</p></li>
      <li><p><term>Partisan Symmetry</term>: Whether both parties would be treated equally under the district plan</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These mathematical tools are increasingly used in court cases challenging redistricting plans as unconstitutional gerrymanders.</p>
