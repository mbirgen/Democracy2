    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>sequential coalition</term> is...
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        A coalition of all voters in a particular order.
        The assumption is that coalitions are formed sequentially:
        Players join the coalition and cast their votes in an orderly sequence.

            Creating a list of all sequential coalitions gets complicated when the number of players gets large.

          List all the sequential coalitions.
          How many are there?

          To calculate the power of a voter, count the number of times the voter is pivotal.
          Then divide by the total number of sequential coalitions.

          In some cities the city council operates under a “strong mayor” system:
          The council can pass a motion by simple majority, but the mayor can veto it.
          The mayor's veto can be overruled by a supermajority.
          In Ice-n-knock, the council has four members plus a strong mayor who can vote and veto.
          A motion passes if the mayor +2 or more council members approve it,
          or if the mayor is against it and all four council members support it.
