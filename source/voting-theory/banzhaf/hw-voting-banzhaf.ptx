          Comparing your answers to parts <xref ref="voting-banzhaf-homework1" text="local"/> and <xref ref="voting-banshaf-homework2" text="local"/>, explain in complete sentences
          why the weight controlled by the voter is not the same thing as the power held by each voter.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          For example, voter <m>P_2</m> has twenty times more weight than voter <m>P_3</m>,
          but they have exactly the same power.
          Another way to see it is that voter <m>P_1</m> has three times as much power as voter <m>P_2</m>,
          even though the weights of 24 and 20 are not that different.

    <title>Nassau County Board of Supervisors</title>
    
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Nassau County, New York used to be governed by a Board of Supervisors.
        The county had six districts, each of which sent one delegate to vote on county issues.
        The delegates' votes were weighted proportionately to the districts' population in 1964:

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What percentage of the county population lived in districts that are dummies?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Since the weights are proportionate to the population,  
          <m>(21 + 2 + 2)/115 = 25/115 â‰ˆ 21.7%</m> of the population had no say at all.
        </p>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In 1965 John F. Banzhaf III argued in court that even though the weights were proportionate to population,
          this system of government was unfair. He won!
