                  any set of players that might join forces and vote the same way.
                In principle, we can have a coalition with as few as <em>one</em> player and as many as <em>all</em> players.
                The coalition consisting of all the players is called the <alert>grand coalition</alert>.
                Since coalitions are just sets of players, the most convenient way to describe coalitions mathematically is to use the <em>set</em> notation.

                  one that has enough votes to win.
                A single player coalition can be a winning coalition only when that player is a dictator, so under the assumption that there are no dictators in our weighted voting system (dictators are boring) a winning coalition must have at least two players.

                The U.N.

                A motion can pass only if it has the vote of <em>all five</em> of the permanent members plus at least four of the non-permanent members.
