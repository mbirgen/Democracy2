        <li>
            <p>
                Deriving a very useful formula:  The basic idea for a future value annuity is that every 
                month we receive compound interest on our new payment along with all of our previous payments.
        
                Therefore at each time when we are going to compound the interest, each payment has been compounded an additional time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Example: Payment is paid four times a year and the interest is compounded quarterly 
                for an annual interest rate of <m>r</m> for one year:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Start: 0
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            After quarter one: <m>R</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            After quarter two the original <m>R</m> is compounded once now and we pay an additional <m>R</m>
                            <me>
                                R (1 +\frac{r}{4}) + R
                            </me>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            After quarter three the original <m>R</m> has been compounded twice, the second <m>R</m> has been compounded once, and we pay an additional <m>R</m>
                            <me>
                                R(1+\frac{r}{4})^{2} + R (1 +\frac{r}{4}) + R
                            </me>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            After quarter four (one year) the original <m>R</m> has been compounded three times, the second <m>R</m> has been compounded twice, the third <m>R</m> has been compounded once, and we pay an additional <m>R</m>
                            <me>
                                R(1+\frac{r}{4})^{3}+ R(1+\frac{r}{4})^{2} + R (1 +\frac{r}{4}) + R
                            </me>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Thus you can see the pattern that the original payment will always be compounded one less that compounding period, which in general will be <m>nt</m> for <m>n</m> compounds per year and <m>t</m> total years
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The general formula for Future Value <m>F</m> is
                            <me>
                F=R(1 +\frac{r}{n})^{nt-1}+R(1 +\frac{r}{n})^{nt-2}+\cdots +R(1 +\frac{r}{n})^{1}+R
            </me>
            </p>
            <p>
            <me>
                F=R\frac{(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}-1}{\frac{r}{n}}                
            </me>
            </p>

                An annuity is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals.
                For an ordinary annuity, the payments are made at the <em>end</em> of the interval.
                annuity!ordinary If the payments are made at the <em>beginning</em> of the interval, 
                it is called an annuity due.
                We will not be working with this type of annuity in this class.annuity!due

            <p>
                A good way to think about these is as a savings account.
                You are putting some money, <m>R</m>, into the account every compounding period in order 
                to save up for something in the future.
