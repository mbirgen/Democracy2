            <p>
            She deposited a total of <m>\$50 \cdot 52\cdot 14 = \$36{,}400</m>, so the interest

           Isaac is graduating from Wartburg College and wants to have $20,000 ready for a down payment 
           on a house in 5 years.
        </p>

            If  investments pay 6% interest, compounded monthly, how much money should  invest every month in 
order to achieve  goal? 
        </p>
        <answer>
            <p>
We want <m>\$20{,}000 = P \dfrac{(1+\frac{0.06}{12})^{12\cdot 5}-1}{\frac{0.06}{12}}</m>,  
so <m>P = \$20{,}000 \div \dfrac{(1+\frac{0.06}{12})^{12\cdot 5}-1}{\frac{0.06}{12}}= \boxed{\$286.66.}</m>

            Karen said would set up an ordinary annuity for  newborn niece Gloria and deposit 
            $100 each month, with the last payment to occur on Gloria's 18th birthday.
            The payments would earn 6% annual interest, compounded monthly.

                How much will Gloria have on her 18th birthday?

                <answer>
            <p>
                <m>\$100\dfrac{(1+\frac{.06}{12})^{12\cdot 18}-1}{\frac{.06}{12}}=

            Karen's spouse Mark suggested they should just deposit a lump sum of money 
            <em>now</em> into a bank account (earning 6% annual interest, compounded monthly), 
            so that it would grow to the same amount by Gloria's 18th birthday as you found above.
            If they go with Mark's plan, how much money must the loving relatives deposit in the 
            account now?
        </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
            <p>
                We want to find <m>P</m> such that <m>\$38735.32=P\left(1+\frac{.06}{12}\right)^{12\cdot 18}</m>;
                 solving, we find they would need to deposit $13,189.79 today.

            Jim decides to pay $300 at the end of each month into an ordinary annuity that pays 8%
            annual interest, compounded monthly, for five years.
            Jim decides to calculate the future value of this annuity at the end of five years, but Jim
             makes a mistake in his calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>
                FV = P  ( (1+i)^{m}-1*i)
            </me>
            <me>
                FV = 300  *( (1+.08)^{60}-1.08)
            </me>
            <me>
                FV = 300 * 1253.213296 = $375,963.99
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            What was  mistake? Is  answer too big or too small?
        </p>
    <answer>
        <p>
            They used <m>i=.08</m>, which is wrong.
            The <em>annual</em> interest rate is <m>.08</m>, but the interest rate 
            <em>per month</em> is only <m>.08/12\approx .0066667</m>.
The answer is too big.
