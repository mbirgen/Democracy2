                            Complete the three-year ledger below, rounding every 
                            interest entry to <em>two</em> decimal places (cents).

                            After finishing the ledger, verify your final balance with the compound-interest 
                            formula <me>F = P(1+\frac r n)^{nt}.</me> The 
                            two answers should agree to the cent if every ledger line is correct.
